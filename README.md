# ARCH 5424 Direct Cinema Media Fabrics
Direct Cinema Media Fabrics is a workshop and seminar. The cinema has expanded to encompass a wide range of media and methods, transcending architecture, sculpture, theater, animation, scientific discovery and environmental art. We explore methods of capturing moving images, sound and potentially other sensory input through videography, computervision, and microcontrollers, discerning key patterns and shapes, and transforming them into creative virtual or physical forms. It is anticipated students willenroll in the class from different fields, such as from design, studio art, media studies, digital music, and computer science, and that final projects will vary accordingly.
